      - titleen: Our New Survey Reveals Safety Risks in Large Models
        subtitleen: '#Language'
        contenten: >-
          In our latest survey "Safety at Scale: A Comprehensive Survey of Large
          Model Safety", we systematically analyze safety threats facing today's
          large AI models. We identify key vulnerabilities across vision,
          language, and multimodal large models. Our findings highlight the
          urgent need for robust safety measures and collaborative efforts to
          ensure trustworthy AI development. The complete survey is now
          available.

        subtitleen: '#Vision'
        contenten: >-
          As the safety of vision models remains a cornerstone of AI research,
          we are excited to launch the VisionSafety Platform. This innovative
          platform is designed to evaluate the safety of vision models through
          the creation of more powerful, transferable adversarial attacks,
          alongside the release of million-scale, real-world adversarial
          datasets. This initiative marks a significant step forward in
          enhancing the security and resilience of vision-based AI systems.

      - titleen: Launching the Multimodal Safety Project
        subtitleen: '#Multimodal'
        contenten: >-
          The rise of multimodal AI presents significant new risks. In response,
          we are launching the Multimodal Safety Research Project, which aims to
          drive community-led research on securing multimodal AI systems. This
          initiative seeks not only to build safe and secure multimodal models
          but also to develop techniques that prevent these systems from being
          misused or turning harmful.
